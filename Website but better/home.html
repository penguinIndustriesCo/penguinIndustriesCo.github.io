    <div><h3>Welcome to our Webpage!</h3>
    <p>We are a small business right here in Melbourne! We work very hard on everything we make.<br> A new product is generally realised every month or so. We hope you enjoy anything that we make.<br>
    We take care in the products we make. But why? Why do we do this?<br> We make these wooden things to fundairse.<br> Scouts believe that every scout should have a chance to go to a massive 2-week scout camp.<br> But there's one problem, it costs $3000. That's why I made Penguin Industries Co.<br> To try and get to Queensland, I hope you join this journey with me.<br> Have a great day!
