    <p>I started a fast, I ate a large meal so that could keep me going. I started the fast and I didn’t eat for 24 hours, I went to school with out food. Afterwards, I ate a bit of food. Before the challenge, I signed up to the 40 Hour Famine website and added myself to my youth group’s team, if you would like to donate, please do so through this link: <a href="https://40hourfamine.com.au/t/plenty-life-youth">https://40hourfamine.com.au/t/plenty-life-youth</a>

        It was very hard telling myself that I can’t eat during the 24 hours, and even harder to not have dinner with my family. The meal before the fast kind of ruined the point as I felt semi-full during the challenge. This challenge did give me an insight to what it would be like without food in other countries. Overall, it made me more away of the starvation of some of the developing countries.

        This helped me to fight poverty by telling showing me what it is like to live in it. This helps the world by giving fortunate people a better insight into what the less fortunate have to deal with and that we should donate and the support the organisations that go out and feed people. I would highly recommend you do this as well.
