                <b>Red Hot Chili Peppers</b> 
                <br>
                Flea is one of the most renowed bassists in the world, influencing millions of musicians around the globe. Known for his groovy slap and pop techniques, without the help of any of the other Peppers, he can get you moving instantly.

                <br>
                Paul treats his bass like a lead instrument, not a supporting act. Creating catchy riffs like "Day Tripper" and "Taxman" that are instantly recogniseble. He has influenced Flea as well, another one of the greatest players. You can hear their similarity in the songs "Come Together" and "Give It Away"

                <b>Nirvana</b> 
                <br>
                Krist isn't like the other 2 bassists mentioned. Generally he likes to tie his bass sections with Kurt Cobain's guitar sections creating a nice harmony giving the music some depth. Sometimes in Nirvana's music Kurt plays a power chord while Krist would play the root note. You can see this in songs like "Smells like Teen Spirit" and "Lithium". Krist also has some general basslines that are quite simple but are very cathcy such as "Sliver"
