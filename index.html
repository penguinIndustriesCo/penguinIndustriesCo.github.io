        Poverty is a massive <b>global problem</b> and we need to fix it. To combat it, I’ve participated in the 40 hour famine, donated to a food drive, and made a website to tell everyone. This website also includes how you can help
    </p>

    <p>
    Poverty is where someone may not have the necessary things to survive. Such as a bed to sleep in, not enough food, being homeless, and not having a source of income. In extreme cases they may not have any of these things, and can be life threatening.

    <p>
        Please have a look at each of the tabs to find out what has been done, and what you can do. Below is an example of extreme poverty.
