    <p>Water can be used to help so many communities all around the world ranging from the least populated communities to the most populated. some practical ways we can achieve this goal, are making portable hydropower plants that go in a moving river that can power anything that needs powering. Bigger communities can invest in in bigger and longer term hydropower plants that provide more electricity.</p>
