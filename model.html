<h2>Our Model</h2>
   <br>
   <p>We made a model of a Hydropower plant! this uses DC motors to generate electricity. basically, if you put a current through the motor, then it'll spin. But if you spin the motor, then it'll create it's own current.</p>
   <br>
   <p>At the time of writing this website we don't know if we're going to use batteries as an example on this model or if we're going to put water down a pipe.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Either way, we're going to have a 3-D printed turbine that can show how water falling and generate electricity. Below is a photo of the turbine and the DC motor </p>
