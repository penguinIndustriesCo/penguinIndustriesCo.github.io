    <h1>The History</h1>
    <p class="p">
The Fender P Bass is the most popular electric bass of all time, and the one we're selling. 
It came out in October of 1951, but only launched until the summer NAMM show in 1952. 
It was designed be Leo Fender and one of the first elctric basses.
For guitarists, the upright bass was extremely daunting to play, without frets, and the high action, made it seem like something thats impossible to learn.
Fender wanted to create an electric fretted bass, held like a guitar that guitarists could pick up easily to help them make money.
The P bass was very different from anything that came before it. There hadn't been any instruments like this before it.
<br><br>
His first design used flat wound strings from the VC Squier Company, a simple pickup, 1 volume knob, and a tone knob.
As well as this it had carbon saddles, bridge and pickup covers to shield the instrument.
The bridge cover also muted the strings, making tghe instrument sound more like an upright bass.
The scale length was 34", a standard for modern day basses, it was tuned in an EADG configuration, the first 4 strings on a guitar, tuned an octave lower.
Fender also designed the Bassman, a low wattage amp that was impressive for the time, sold with the bass.

Fender wanted the bass to be adopted by country musicians in Southern California, response was lackluster.
Fender then went to night club, where a jazz band was playing, and he met Roy Johnson who was the band's upright player, he heard the sound of the P bass, and Fender gave it to him for free.
When people heard heard the band again, they were shocked as they didn't have and upright player, yet they heard bass. This was Roy's playing.
Dusty Hill of ZZ Top also adopted the instrument.
<br><br>
A lot of changes came in 1954 to appeal to a wider audience.
The saddles were changed to metal and were made more adjustable, and the iconic sunburst design was introduced.
In 1957, split coil pickups were introduced that were hum cancelling, making bass quieter. The two magnets per string design lowered magnetic string pull.
Sting, the bass player from The Police uses this iteration of this P bass to this day.
In the same year, Elvis Presley released the song "Jail House Rock" which was the first major hit to use an electric bass.
<br><br>
By 1958, people were going wild for the instrument, and had solidified it as a staple of music.
From now on, the changes to the instrument were subtle.
A lot of the bands of the British Invasion including the Beatles, Rolling Stones, and the Who all used the bass.
Fender also switched to a white plastic scratch plate as the nitro cellulous one deteriated, it broke down and emitted gases that lead to corosion of the metal components.
Black Sabbath's Geezer Butler used a p bass in the 70s and Iron Maiden's, Steve Harriss also uses one.
<br><br>
Nowadays, due to the lack of instrumental music, it's rare to see the bass played like it was before.
The closest we may get today is Flea, where the Chili Peppers are almost at the end of their career, where it's practically a miracle they're still making music with a real bass.
The P bass is a classic instrument, that we would love to see the younger generation picking up and playing.
Who knows? We may even have the next Paul McCartney on our hands!
